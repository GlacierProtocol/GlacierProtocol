# counterfeit_stop
counterfeit_stop is a fork of the Glacier protocol for secure cold storage of bitcoins and use for uniquely identifying products. 

if bitcoin is a system for labeling balances with keys to prove who owns them, why can't we label products in a way customers can verify where they came from? 

Owners of a company can safely secure coins offline at an address which is posted publicly to it's webpage and social media accounts. 
Funds from this address can be sent to individual addresses which correspond with product serial numbers. The product serial number is used as the password for a BIP38 wallet that is loaded onto an NFC tag and placed  inside the packaging. The packaging is sealed with tamper evident seals. The customer can open the package, scan the tag with an application, enter the serial, and sweep the funds, and see that they came from the producers public address.

this is just an idea. no one has reviewed this. I've just started writing code.
